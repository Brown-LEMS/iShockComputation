# TODO (GOALS/AGENDA)
- Update the CXX as much as possible without breaking the build (currently on 14 and working fine, though)
- Decipher the src (following state flow through compute_ishock_main_save_esf.cpp, which is Murathi's main file)
- Isolate VXL dependencies
- Refactor & Replace VXL dependencies
